<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Sarah Hovenkamp - I'm an artist, a writer, a pet-sitter, as well as an avid learner and life-long student - which is why I'm here, creating this website!
  Right now, I am in the process of taking <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/">The Complete Web Development Bootcamp 2023</a> 
  on Udemy.com. It is absolutely fantastic, I love the teacher, and I can't wait to continue to practice what I learn on this website. So stay tuned!
</p>

<p>A little bit more about me... I'm adventurous and adore traveling yet I absolutely love having days
   where I stay cozied up at the house with a good book, my coursework, or an art project. I have the greatest family of all Time 
   A fantastic mom and dad, younger brother and two older sisters who are all my absolute closest friends! In addition to learning Web Development,
   I am taking courses to learn Spanish, American Sign Language, and soon will begin one on Adobe Indesign. Saying that I love learning is an understatement!
</p>

<p>What are my plans with learning Web Development, you may ask? Well, I would like to integrate what I've learned from
  several courses in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop over the last few months, and learn just one more way to express myself artistically
  through creating websites. If I do well, I'd truly consider a career in this... with high hopes I'd be able to make my income with 
  flexibility of location and time, and be able to travel more.

  That's all for now! Thank you for reading... 

  -Sarah
